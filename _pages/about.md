I am a Lecturer of Biophysics in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London. My research interests are in the physical basis of fidelity, specificity, and adaptability in biology. I am particularly interested in how networks of molecular interactions permit and define the evolutionary fate of an adapting system.

Problems span timescales from the physiological to the evolutionary, though often at the cellular or molecular level. I use techniques from physics (statistical physics, information theory, evolutionary dynamics) as well as experimental biology approaches (molecular biology, yeast genetics, laboratory evolution).

Prior to this, I was a Yen Biophysics Fellow in the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago, in the group of Arvind Murugan. From 2018 to 2021 I was supported by a fellowship from the James S. McDonnell Foundation. I did my PhD with Madan Rao and Jitu Mayor at the NCBS, Bangalore, where I worked on the organisation and transfer of information at the cell surface.
