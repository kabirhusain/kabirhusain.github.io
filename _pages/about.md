I work on problems at the intersection of statistical physics and evolution. Modern moleular biology often focuses
on the function of biological systems, without addressing their evolutionary origins. In contrast, theories of evolution are
often devoid of molecular and biophysical constraints. My work seeks to bridge the two in a synergistic way: deriving
evolutionary parameters from underlying molecular constraints, while searching for biophysical signatures of evolvability
in real biological systems. The overarching goal is to understand how biology builds adaptive, reconfigurable matter, so
that we may exploit the same principles in directed evolution, synthetic biology, and materials design.

My work uses tools from theory (statistical physics, information theory, evolutionary dynamics) as well as experimental biology approaches (molecular biology, yeast genetics, laboratory evolution).

Prior to this, I was a Yen Biophysics Fellow in the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago, in the group of Arvind Murugan. From 2018 to 2021 I was supported by a fellowship from the James S. McDonnell Foundation. I did my PhD with Madan Rao and Jitu Mayor at the NCBS, Bangalore, where I worked on the organisation and transfer of information at the cell surface.
