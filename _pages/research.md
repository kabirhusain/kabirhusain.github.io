How does biology get to be the way it is? We're working to deconstruct the creative engine of biology, to better understand how it works, and to learn how to repurpose it as an engineering tool.

<!-- How are the products of evolution different from man-made systems?  -->

Unlike human design-test-build cycles, biology generates novelty by the iterative process of mutation and selection -- that is, evolution. Evolution is not simply a matter of historical record: many of the phenomena that we as biologists engage with today are cases of this creative engine at work. Pathogens and our immune system play an evolutionary cat-and-mouse game, with antibodies continually evolving to neutralise rapidly mutating viral targets. Cancers are, in great part, a disease of evolution, an unstable mode in evolutionary dynamics. And in this age of biotechnology and synthetic biology, there is a lot of interest in harnessing laboratory evolution to make designer biomolecules.

We take a variety of approaches to this problem -- both theoretical and experimental. Our research sits at the interface of physics, molecular biology, and evolution.
